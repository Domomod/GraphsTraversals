/*
Adjacency Matrix is a Graph Representation more at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix
#Variables:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
tab (long long int**): 
    a dynamically alocated matrix to store data
n (int):
    number of nodes
temp (int):
    a counter used in DFS and BFS, it represtents index of table sorted to which those functions
    write nodes, when temp = 0, calculation is over and traversal is found
visited (int*):
    pointer to a table for DFS traversal, declared as a member variable, because DFS 
    itself is implemented recursively and need this table in every lever of recursion,
        this table contains a map of visited nodes
sorted (int*):
    pointer to a table containing a traversal (BFS or DFS)
#Methods:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
constructor:
    dynamically create a matrix, visited, and sorted table
fill:
    fill the matrix with data
destructor:
    frees memory
getters:
    there are getters for:
        :GetN(void):    - n 
        :GetVisited(x): - visited[x] (x given as param, unsafe does not check if x is valid)
        :GetTab(void):  - tab (return int**)
printers:
    there are printers for:
        :printTab(void):    - prints the matrix
        :orintSorted(void): - prints the sorted, use only after sortDFS or sortBFS, otherwise it
        will print gibberish
DFS:
    a step of recursive DFS traversal computing
sortDFS:
    find a DFS traversal
    WARNING:
        THE CODE DOES NOT CHECK IF OUR GRAPH IS DAG, WE ASSUMED IT IS, BECAUSE WE
        ARE ALWAYS GENERATING DAG GRAPHS.
sortBFS:
    find a BFS traversal
