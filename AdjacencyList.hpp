/*
Adjacency List is a Graph Representation, read more at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list
#Variables:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
lists (STL list of int): 
    pointer to table of adjacency list, one for every node in the graph
size (int):
    number of nodes
visited (int*):
    pointer to a table for DFS traversal, declared as a member variable, because DFS 
    itself is implemented recursively and need this table in every lever of recursion,
        this table contains a map of visited nodes
predecessors (int*):
    pointer to a table for BFS traversal, declared as a member variable,
        each position of the table contains a number of predecessors so far not visited 
sorted (int*):
    pointer to a table containing a traversal (BFS or DFS)
type (int):
    type of adjacecny matrix, base on the enumerator:
        NEXT - list of succesors
        PREV - list of predecesors
        NOINCIDENCY - list of nodes with which there is no connection to current node
#Methods:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
constructor:
    can create our class from AdjacencyMatrix(passed by copy or pointer), or a pointer
    to table of tables (aka. pointer to a pointer), this table is treated same as
    AdjacencyMatrix), all the constructors use the function initialize 
    (for reusing the same code)
destructor:
    frees memory
DFS:
    a step of recursive DFS traversal computing
sortDFS:
    find a DFS traversal
    WARNING:
        THE CODE DOES NOT CHECK IF OUR GRAPH IS DAG, WE ASSUMED IT IS, BECAUSE WE
        ARE ALWAYS GENERATING DAG GRAPHS.
sortBFS:
    find a BFS traversal
    WARNING:
        THE CODE DOES NOT CHECK IF OUR GRAPH IS DAG, WE ASSUMED IT IS, BECAUSE WE
        ARE ALWAYS GENERATING DAG GRAPHS.
